libnifalcon 
===========
Version 1.0.1, September 20, 2009

== Description ==

libnifalcon is a development library for the NovInt Falcon, and is an
open source, crossplatform alternative to NovInt's SDK.

libnifalcon provides basic functionality to connect to the falcon and
load firmware to the internal microcontroller. In addition, it comes
with sample functionality made available through the firmware
available in NovInt's drivers (the novint.bin file in TestUtilties and
the nifalcon_test_fw files for the library source). This firmware is
distributed in the firmware directory of the source distribution, and
is required for the findfalcons utility to run.

Compilation directions are included in the COMPILE.txt file

libnifalcon is now a supported device in the H3D Haptics Framework.
More information on this is available at

http://www.h3d.org

== Novint Falcon Information  ==

More information about the Novint Falcon can be found at

http://home.novint.com

Technical information, including protocol and hardware information, is
available at the libnifalcon website

== Library Requirements ==

=== cmake ===

http://www.cmake.org

=== ftd2xx (Recommended for Windows) ===

http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm

=== libusb 1.0 (Recommended for Linux or Mac) ===

http://www.libusb.info

== ftd2xx versus libusb 1.0 ==

libnifalcon can use two different libraries to access the falcon:

FTD2XX - Library distributed by FTDI themselves

* Windows: OK - RECOMMENDED
* Linux: Untested
* OS X: Untested

libusb-1.0 (use whatever the latest version is. As of this writing, 1.0.2):

* Windows: Not Available for Windows
* Linux: OK - RECOMMENDED
* OS X: OK - RECOMMENDED

Note that libnifalcon has been written in such a way that which comm
library you use should have little effect on the cross-platform
performance of your code. However, this is more of a hope than a
promise.

== What Comes With libnifalcon ==

With libnifalcon, you get

* libnifalcon
** Provides device access to the falcon
* libnifalcon_cli_base
** Provides base class for small test applications for the falcon
* libnifalcon_thread
** Provides example of threaded device support for the falcon
* Example Programs (all require libnifalcon, plus other libraries as
  specified)
** findfalcons - Prints out the number of falcon devices connected,
   opens each of them (one at a time), runs simple test (changes LED
   color, runs a few thousand I/O loops). Good for making sure things
   'just work'.
** findfalcons_multi - Same as findfalcons, but all falcons at once.
   For testing multiple communications/devices.
** barrow_mechanics - Alastair Barrow's original implementation of the
   RL Stamper kinematics system used in the libnifalcon kinematics
   core
** falcon_led (requires libnifalcon_cli_base) - Simple example
   application for extending FalconCLIBase class.
** falcon_mouse (requires libnifalcon_cli_base) - Lets the falcon
   position control the mouse cursor
** falcon_test_cli (requires libnifalcon_cli_base) - Suite of test
   scenes for the falcon (cube, walls, timing tests, etc...)
* SWIG bindings (requires SWIG and whatever language bindings you want
  to use)
** FalconBridge proxy class for accessing the falcon from other
   languages. Tested with Java and Python so far.

== Platform Specifics ==

=== Windows ===

* If you are using the falcon on Windows, even if it's a Windows VM,
  make sure it's plugged in directly to a port on the machine
  you're on. Hubs don't work with the falcon on Windows.
* NovInt uses the stock ftd2xx drivers, and it is recommended to use a
  ftd2xx version of libnifalcon on windows. If you have installed the
  drivers from NovInt's website, access through libnifalcon should
  "just work".
* Building under Visual Studio will only work for STATIC libraries, as
  I'm too lazy to add the declspec calls.

=== Linux ===

* If you are using the falcon on Linux with an older kernel
  (pre-v3.14, though earlier may work), make sure it's plugged in
  through a powered USB hub. For some reason, plugging it directly
  into a Linux Box causes it to work erractically.
* Programs built with libnifalcon (including example programs that
  come with the library) requires either root access (i.e. running
  under sudo) or correct udev based USB permissions to run as
  non-root. There's a sample udev file in the "linux" directory of the
  distribution that can help.

#### Setup udev-based USB permissions

To set udev-based USB permissions to run programs built with libnifalcon as non-root:

* Setup udev permissions (tested with Ubuntu 19.04):
....
sudo cp linux/40-novint-falcon-udev.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger
....
* Re-plug your device

=== OS X ===

* If you are using the falcon on OS X, make sure it's plugged in
  through a powered USB hub. For some reason, plugging it directly
  into a Mac causes it to work erractically.
